This program is a quiz game written in the C programming language. The quiz game consists of several questions and possible answers. The player will be asked to choose the correct answer from the list of options. If the player chooses the correct answer, they earn a point, and the program will move on to the next question.

The program starts by defining a "Question" data structure, which includes the text of the question, a list of possible answers, and the index of the correct answer.

Next, the program has two functions: "askQuestion" and "runQuiz." The "runQuiz" function is the main function that runs the quiz. It takes a list of questions and calls "askQuestion" for each question. The "askQuestion" function displays the question and possible answers to the player, prompts the player to choose an answer, and checks if the player's answer is correct. If the answer is correct, the player earns a point. If the answer is incorrect, the program moves on to the next question.

Finally, the program defines a list of questions and calls "runQuiz" with the list of questions to start the quiz.

That's it! Overall, this program is a fun and simple quiz game that you can play and learn from.
